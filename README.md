# Auctions

To run it, you need python and Django.
Go to the root of the folder and enter the command:

### python manage.py runserver
Also you need to install django-jinja!
https://pypi.org/project/django-jinja/

### add '/auctions' to your local server address
### And you're good to go :)

If you want to use the uploaded DB for a quick view, these are the users already registerd (parentheses contains password):

Lana (l)
Lulu (l)
Reinhold (r)

... of course you can wipe the DB (in your own repository download) and set up your own user traffic.
